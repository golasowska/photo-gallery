Photo-gallery app has been created using React and Redux and it was bootstrapped with Create React App.

This is a simple photo gallery that utilizes Flickr API as a photo database.

In the searchbar that appears on the main page, just enter the searched phrase.
The pictures related to the tag will be uploaded below as small square thumbnails.

When scrolling down more photos will be loaded.

If you want to see the enlarged picture just click on it.
A new window will appear with a larger version of the photo and with a table containing EXIF data related to the photo.
